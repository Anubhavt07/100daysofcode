Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.
Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* removeLeafNodes(TreeNode* root, int target) {
        TreeNode* l=NULL, *r=NULL;
        if (root->left) l=removeLeafNodes(root->left, target);
        if (root->right) r=removeLeafNodes(root->right, target);
        root->left=l, root->right=r;
        if (!root->left && !root->right && root->val==target) 
            root=NULL;
        return root;
    }
};
