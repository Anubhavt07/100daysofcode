Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

class Solution {
public:
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int res = 0;
        diameter(root, res);
        return res;
    }
private:
    int diameter(TreeNode* curr, int& res){
        if (!curr) return 0;
        int left = diameter(curr->left, res);
        int right = diameter(curr->right, res);
        res = std::max(res, left + right);
        return std::max(left, right) + 1;
    }
