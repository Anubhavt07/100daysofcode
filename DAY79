// A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:

// It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
// It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
// It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
// We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

    int maxDepth(string s) {
        int count = 0;
        int max_num = 0;
        for (char c : s) {

                count++;
                if (max_num < count)
