You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.
Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.
A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

class Solution {
public:
    int appendCharacters(string s, string t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0; 
        while (i < s.length() && j < t.length()) { 
            if (s[i] == t[j]) {  
                j++;  
            }
            i++; 
        }
        return t.length() - j; 
    }
};
