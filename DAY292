Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.
A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.
For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.

class Solution {
public:
    bool rotateString(string& s, string& goal) {
        return s.size()==goal.size() && (s+s).find(goal)!=-1;
    }
};
