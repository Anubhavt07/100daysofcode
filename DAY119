// In a gold mine grid of size m x n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.
// Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:
// Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
// From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
// You can't visit the same cell more than once.
// Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
// You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.
