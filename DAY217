// Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones.  There are a number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].  The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. 
// Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.  Initially, M = 1.
// On each player's turn, that player can take all the stones in the first X remaining piles, where 1 <= X <= 2M.  Then, we set M = max(M, X).
// The game continues until all the stones have been taken.
// Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.
